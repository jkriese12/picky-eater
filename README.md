### About the Project

#### This was a group project to develop a recipe application. The project scope sought to provide a resource for people with food allergies and sensitivities to find healthy recipes matching their dietary restrictions. The application was to have a clean and polished mobile first UI rendering responsively across a variety of devices. 

#### Completion of the acceptance criteria implemented the following:
```
GIVEN a person has food allergies restricting them to gluten-free meals:
WHEN they search for recipes in the application,
THEN they can specify diet restrictions by toggling a switch for gluten-free options.
WHEN they view the recipe, they can view recipe ingredients, recipe instructions and a link to view more information about the recipe.
WHEN they enter criteria for viewing a recipe, they can also opt to view current weather conditions in Tahiti.
WHEN they are finished viewing recipes, they can choose to look up more information on nutrition, measurement conversions, diet trends in a food academy. 
THEN they can also view featured recipes. 
WHEN they perform a subsequent search, their prior search will persist and show on the screen as the last searched item.
```
